EUS problems
ISR+PHE
There is a Lagrangian-approach, but no details.

2.1 The L-ISR-PHE Workflow

2.2 Research on in situ data reduction

2.3 Research on PHE Lagrangian 

2.4 Other Relevant Research

== 3: Title ==

What is the space of an empirical study?

Three factors:
1) evaluation metrics
2) instantiations of L-ISR-PHE
3) workloads

3.1: Evaluation Areas
3.1.1: ISR
IS-E1: memory usage
IS-E2: execution time
IS-E3: ease of integration
3.1.2: DS
DS-E1: file size
DS-E2: file format
DS-E3: file write/read time
3.1.3: PHE
PH-E1: memory usage 
PH-E2: execution time
PH-E3: accuracy

3.2: instantiations
There are many possible instantiations.  With this study, we chose current
best practices.
We intend for future research on improved instantiations to revisit
our evaluations (or similar ones) to establish that they have improved
on best practices.
