Abstract: perhaps we revisit

== Intro ==

- Hank reviews new version
- Add perspective: how unsteady flow vis affects Eulerian.
"The result of this is that a velocity field interpolation using the traditional
method has to do a temporal interpolation, and this temporal interpolation is occurring
over increasing large times, which can introduce error."
- Revisit contributions in the final paragraph and audit for what statements make sense to the reader who has just read the intro and which ones do not.  The ones that do not should go in the conclusion.


== Section 3 ==

3.1: Workflow overview
Formula:
Theoretical
Practical
Metrics
3.1.1: In situ reduction
\textbf{Theoretical Perspectives:}
\textbf{Practical Perspectives:}
\textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
3.1.2: Data storage
3.1.3: Post hoc exploration
3.2: Comparator
3.3: Factors

4.1: light edits to indicate parameter space has been moved up
4.1: table 1 -- better represent SW4
4.1.2: move to 3.5
4.1.1: promote to its own subsection (not subsubsection)
4.2: sore point.  Let's see how we are doing on space.
4.4.2 & 4.4.3: swapped and re-oriented towards evaluation metrics in 3.2 and 3.3.

Section 5: text re-organized: 5.1 is in situ encumbrance, 5.2 is post hoc efficacy
Section 5: Combine Tables 5, 6, 7.
Section 5: small multiples plots -- remove axes, bigger, etc. 

Section 6: need conclusion

possible new table:
			# particles	interval	grid size	concurrency	
EM-IS1: execution time   more		???		???		no change
EM-IS2: memory		 more	
EM-DS1: bytes
EM-DS2: time
EM-PH1: execution time
EM-PH2: accuracy
